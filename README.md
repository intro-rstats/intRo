Here you can find the **learning materials** for the workshop *intRo:
Data Analysis with R* ([learnB4SS](https://learnb4ss.github.io)).

For information about the workshop (dates and times, contents, etc), see
the [homepage](https://intro-rstats.github.io).

## Let’s get started!

Before the day of the workshop, you will need to prep your computer.

If you are experiencing issue with software installation, we kindly ask
you to first refer to your institutional IT help desk. If your
institution does not offer an IT help desk, then feel free to send an
email to the workshop organiser.

### Prerequisites

The first step is to install the software requirements. If you haven’t
yet done so, check out the installation instructions
[here](https://intro-rstats.github.io/intRo/articles/get-started.html).

### Equality, diversity and inclusion

Everybody is welcome to the workshop.

We are strongly committed to principles of equality, diversity and
inclusion, and we are doing our best to provide you with a safe and
inclusive learning environment.

In light of this objective, we kindly ask you to fill the pre-workshop
form to let us know a little about yourself, your background and your
needs.

The form and the questions in it are optional, but we strongly recommend
all attendants to fill it in. The link to the form is included in the
confirmation email when you register on Eventbrite, but it will be sent
out again well before the first day of the workshop.
