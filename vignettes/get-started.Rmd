# Welcome!

Hello! We hope you are as excited as we are about the upcoming *intRo* workshop.

In order to get the most from the workshop, you will have to get yourself and your computer ready beforehand.

# Software requirements

You will need to install the following pieces of free software:

- The statistical [programming language](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages/) **R**. This will be the "engine" we will be using to do data visualisation and more.

- The RStudio [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide). If R is the engine, RStudio is the "car", something that helps you take advantage of the powerful engine.

# Install R

Head over to the official R download page: <https://cloud.r-project.org>.

The first heading says `Download and Intall R`. Click on the download link (choose the one with your operating system: Linux, macOS or Windows). You will be redirected to the download page for your operating system.

If you have macOS, install the `Latest release` (`R-4.1.1-arm64` if you have a Mac with an M1 chip, `R-4.1.1` otherwise).

If you have Windows, from the download page click on `install R for the first time` and follow the instructions on the page.

Linux should come with R installed.

# Install RStudio

You can download RStudio from the official page: <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>.

Click on the `Download` button below `RStudio Desktop` and then download the recommended RStudio version for your operating system (no need to install R because you've already done that in the previous step).
