# Welcome!

Hello! We hope you are as excited as we are about the upcoming *intRo* workshop.

In order to get the most from the workshop, you will have to get yourself and your computer ready beforehand.

# Software requirements

You will need to install the following pieces of software:

- The statistical [programming language](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/programming-languages/) **R**. This will be the "engine" we will be using to do data visualisation and more.

- The RStudio [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/what-is-an-ide). If R is the engine, RStudio is the "car", something that helps you take advantage of the powerful engine.
